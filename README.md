# Welcome to PyTorch GAN Trainer

**Quickly train a GAN to generate images!**

A simple module for you to directly import and start training different GAN models.
You can also log your runs with Weight and Biases.

### Aim

-   To create an easy inference to train/save/load different GAN models.
-   To learn how to create a Python package.
-   To learn unit testing with PyTest.
-   To learn how to create documentation with MkDocs.

### How to install?

Using pip, run the following command

```
pip install git+https://github.com/kad99kev/pytorch_gan_trainer.git
```

### How to use?

Please check the Colaboratory notebook to see different examples - [Example Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OD4tRnoZogv194X0SJDWt9Onct2nfcPx?usp=sharing)
